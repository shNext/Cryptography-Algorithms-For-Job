## Overview

my friends, I need some time for the AI based cryptographic algorithm. <br/>
I think that the time to check this algorithm has came. <br/>
in this time, I will entirely look over design of this algorithm and remove unnecessary contents like definition of problem, etc. <br/>
by doing so, I makes the document about design more elaborate because I have found a defect and also the document isn't good for reader.

## Development Cycle

#### how long this takes 

remains 3 ~ 4 months

#### Approach for the modern algorithm

based on the manual/document

#### Approach for implementation of this algorithm

from scratch

#### Approach for the quantum cryptography

simulation-based and research on it.

## Considerations

#### from quantum computing/cryptography

## Conclusion on Chapter #
