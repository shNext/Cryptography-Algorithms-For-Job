## Overview

my friends, I need some time for the AI based cryptographic algorithm.
I think that the time to check this algorithm has came.
in this time, I will entirely look over design of this algorithm and remove unnecessary contents like definition of problem, etc.
by doing so, I makes the document about design more elaborate because I have found a defect and also the document isn't good for reader.

## Development Cycle

#### how long this takes 

just do

#### Project priority

middle

#### Approach for the modern algorithm

based on the manual/document

#### Approach for the concept of the attack-aware self-logic-transformation cryptographic algorithm

top-down

#### Approach for the design/implementation for the algorithm

top-down and bottom-up, from scratch

#### Approach for the quantum cryptography

simulation-based and research on it.

## Considerations

#### from cryptography

explain/describe the algorithm from ai is valid in perspective of cryptography. <br/>
explain/prove/describe strength of the algorithm. <br/>
define the conditions of input/output/parameters used in the algorithm comparing with modern cryptographic algorithm. <br/>
how to measure the performance of algorithm. <br/>
how to minimize the algorithm, how to reduce running-time and memory usage for embedded systems. <br/>
how to enhance/transform strength of attack-aware. <br/>
does this algorithm have meaning in perspective of defending from quantum computing, if it is or not, explain about that specifically. <br/>
where should I focus on the parts of the algorithm for security, find the reason and answer.

#### from quantum computing/cryptography

#### from ai

explain the gain in perspective of information security when utilize the ai. <br/>
how to combine the feature/advantage of ai with cryptography. <br/>
how to change the cryptographic algorithms to the ai operations, specify the advantages of this project, even if the quantum computing is coming. <br/>
how to maximize the on-device edge computing with this. <br/>
comparing memory efficiency and usage between ai-combined or not cryptographic algorithms on embedded systems. <br/>
how to encrypt/decrypt the data without the cryptographic key, specify how to do that. <br/>
if it is possible, explain the gain in the enviroments considering private information security. <br/>
how to assess strength/security level of ai-combined algorithm, how to trust it. <br/>
how to enhance strength of algorithm, attack-aware ai cryptographic algorithm, what is this. <br/>
define the meaning of attack about the ai-combined algorithm. <br/>
attack-aware self-logic-transformation cryptographic algorithm. <br/>
how to ensure the consistency of the algorithm. <br/>
design attack-aware self-logic-transformation cryptographic algorithm. <br/>
think about the effect from the quantum computing to this.
