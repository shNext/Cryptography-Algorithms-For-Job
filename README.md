## Overview

my friends, I have upload a file today. <br/>
although there is no contents I think that the format of document will be fixed as same with this file. <br/>
maybe upload will be on next week or if it needs more time to enrich this document then can be delayed. <br/>
<br/>
have a good day and see you next.

## Development Cycle

#### how long this takes 

remains 3 ~ 4 months

#### Approach for the modern algorithm

based on the manual/document

#### Approach for implementation of this algorithm

from scratch

#### Approach for the quantum cryptography

simulation-based and research on it.

## Considerations

#### from quantum computing/cryptography

## Conclusion on Chapter #
